HW1 was well done. I see where you had some difficulty distinguishing between the later steps, which is somewhat to be expected in this exercise as there wasn't really any way to build charts without actually doing laundry and sorting it. 

Overall, well done. Remember to stick to the process and try to not overthink it.
